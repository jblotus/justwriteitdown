JustWriteItDown
===============

JustWriteItDown is an excuse for me to learn Backbone and other tools on my own terms.

I am using Backbone Boilerplate (https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate) and all the tools that comes with.

The goal is to make a simple todo list application, adding bells and whistles as I get more comfortable with Backbone.

The prototype is being developed on Koding.com and hosted at http://justwriteitdown.jblotus.kd.io/
